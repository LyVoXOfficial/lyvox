2025-10-25 - Pending comprehensive compliance audit for remaining API route handlers (`apps/web/src/app/api/**`) to verify role enforcement, media ownership, and moderator logging. Prioritised after rate-limit contract fix. (ref: compliance run request)
2025-10-25 - Legacy `media.url` records still store public URLs; migrate them to storage paths and purge legacy public assets once users re-upload. (ref: apps/web/src/app/api/media/list/route.ts legacy branch)
2025-10-25 - DB_CHANGELOG: Secure media pipeline reuses existing `media` schema (sort, dimensions) and `logs` table; no migration required. Confirmed compatibility with `supabase/types/database.types.ts`.
2025-10-25 - DEPLOY_LOG: Vehicle form selector was hidden until a specific car subcategory (`transport/legkovye-avtomobili`) was chosen. Updated `/post` to treat any transport category as visible, show helper text, and disable inputs until the car subcategory is picked (commit `[deploy] fix(vehicle-form): ensure cascading make/model/year selector appears for transport`).
